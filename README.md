MuPDF-for-Android---Source-Code---already-built
===============================================

This is the source code for MuPDF, it's already built so no need to try to build it, many of developers are facing many problems during building it, so I decided to help them, you can contact me directly though my email: amrmohsen91@gmail.com
Also, if you want to build it on your own, then follow these steps in that link: http://mupdf.blogspot.com/
You can use the command prompt instead of Cygwin.
